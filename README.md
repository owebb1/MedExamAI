## Medical Exam Question Generator

In this Streamlit application, we are demonstrating the power of AI in creating a personalized and adaptive study aid for medical school students.

MedExamAI is a unique tool designed for medical students who are looking for high-quality practice exam questions and personalized study plans. It uses artificial intelligence to analyze your performance and tailor study plans to your specific needs.

Here's how MedExamAI works:

The application generates 30 exam questions, providing users with a robust sample of potential questions they might encounter in their studies or exams.
These questions are designed with medical school students in mind, and they mirror the complexity and structure of actual test questions.
After users complete the questions, MedExamAI uses artificial intelligence to analyze the responses and determine which questions were answered incorrectly.
The application then uses these insights to create a customized study plan. This plan focuses on the areas where the user had the most difficulty, ensuring that their study time is used as effectively as possible.
